            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am an Aspiring web developer. I learnt to code because I was looking for a career that was more fulfilling and challenging, where no two days are the same and there is always something new to learn. 
                    I am amazed how far i have come. I have learnt the basic of HTML, CSS, JS and currently learning ReactJs which I am really enjoying.</p>
            <p>II love a good laugh. I feel that laughing makes everyone around me happy and more at ease. I also enjoy a good discussion. 
                    In my free time I'm on the computer learning how to code, this is a new area for me and I am really enjoying the challenge. 
                    I love watching movies and there I say it watching animes with my son, skateboarding, going for walks and most importantly family and coffee.</p>
            <p>I am currently looking to be a Front end developer. Hopefully with enough experience looking to be a Full stack developer, aiming to get to a senior level possibly project management. 
                I am also quite keen on Data science, So will look to get into this somewhere along the line.</p>
